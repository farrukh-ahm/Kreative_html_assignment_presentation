        Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins as he and the Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, 
        to ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. 
        The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest with his loyal companion Sam and the treacherous Gollum. 
        Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, along with the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and the wizard Gandalf, 
        unite to save the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from the forces of Sauron and rally them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo by distracting Sauron's attention.
