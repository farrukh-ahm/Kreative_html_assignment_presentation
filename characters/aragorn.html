        Aragorn, also known as Strider, is a central character in J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings." 
        He is a descendant of the ancient kings of men and heir to the throne of Gondor. 
        Initially introduced as a mysterious ranger, Aragorn emerges as a noble and courageous leader, dedicated to the cause of defeating the Dark Lord Sauron. 
        Possessing remarkable skills in combat and strategy, Aragorn earns the trust and respect of his companions as he leads them on the perilous journey to destroy the One Ring. 
        His unwavering resolve, humility, and sense of duty make him a true hero of Middle-earth.
